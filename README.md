# Llama-Chatbot-with-Sentiment-Analysis-Integration

## Project Overview
This project implements a sentiment-aware chatbot that adjusts its responses based on the user's emotional state. By utilizing Hugging Face’s sentiment analysis model, the chatbot can detect positive, neutral, or negative sentiment from user input and tailor its responses accordingly. The project is built using Python, with the Hugging Face `transformers` library for sentiment analysis.

The chatbot aims to provide better customer service by offering different responses depending on the user's mood, improving overall user satisfaction.

## Features
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Detects whether a user is frustrated, satisfied, or neutral.
- **Dynamic Responses**: Tailors chatbot replies based on detected sentiment.
- **Escalation for Negative Feedback**: Offers assistance when negative sentiment is detected.
- **Interactive Chat**: Users can have an ongoing conversation with the chatbot, and responses adapt in real-time.
  
## Tech Stack
- **Google Colab**: Used as the development platform for ease of setup and access to required libraries.
- **Python**: Main programming language.
- **Hugging Face Transformers**: For sentiment analysis.
- **Torch**: Required by Hugging Face models for deep learning computations.

## Model Used
The chatbot uses the `nlptown/bert-base-multilingual-uncased-sentiment` model from Hugging Face, which is a sentiment analysis model trained on user reviews. It classifies sentiment into five categories:
1. Very negative
2. Negative
3. Neutral
4. Positive
5. Very positive

## How It Works
1. **User Input**: The chatbot takes in the user's text input.
2. **Sentiment Detection**: The input is passed through the sentiment analysis model, which detects whether the sentiment is positive, neutral, or negative.
3. **Response Generation**: Based on the sentiment detected:
   - Positive sentiment: The chatbot responds with gratitude or positive reinforcement.
   - Negative sentiment: The chatbot apologizes and offers help.
   - Neutral sentiment: The chatbot provides general assistance.

## Installation and Setup

To run this project on Google Colab:

1. **Clone or Download the Project**: You can directly open the notebook on Colab.
2. **Install Dependencies**: Install the required Python libraries in Colab:
    ```bash
    !pip install transformers
    !pip install torch
    ```
3. **Run the Notebook**: Execute the code cells to interact with the chatbot.

## Usage

1. **Start the chatbot**: Once the environment is set up, run the chatbot and interact with it.
2. **User Interaction**: Type messages as the user, and see how the chatbot responds to different types of sentiment.
3. **Exit**: Type `exit`, `quit`, or `bye` to end the conversation.

Example conversation:

```bash
User: "I'm really unhappy with the service today."
Chatbot: "I'm really sorry to hear you're not happy. How can I assist you further?"

User: "The product is great!"
Chatbot: "Thank you for your positive feedback! I'm glad you're satisfied."
